Make sure you have latest ruby (just kidding):

    rbenv install 1.8.7 # doesnt work :/
    rbenv install 1.9.3-p551 # this seems to work


Simply you need to:

    git clone <repo>
    cp config/smtp_gmail.yml.example config/smtp_gmail.yml # and edit
    rake db:setup

And you should be ready to go:

    script/server

# Obsolete

#as sudoer launch `bin/install-prerequisites`
